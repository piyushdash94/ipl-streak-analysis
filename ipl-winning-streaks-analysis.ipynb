Reaching **14 points (7 wins)** is often seen as the minimum threshold to stay in the playoff race — but it's not a guarantee. Unless a team has a favorable **Net Run Rate (NRR)**, even 7 wins can fall short. On the other hand, **8 wins (16 points)** is typically a safe ticket to the playoffs.\n\nBut here's the twist — **what if a team is never allowed to win more than 2 matches in a row**?  \nThis notebook explores that exact constraint:  \n> 🔁 How often can teams qualify if they’re not allowed to build long winning streaks?\n\nWe break this down using two approaches:\n\n### 🧮 1. Pure Combinatorics\nWe start with a mathematical baseline: each match is a fair coin toss — a 50-50 win/loss scenario. This helps us understand how many valid qualification paths exist under the streak constraint.\n\n### 🧪 2. Realistic Simulations\nNext, we simulate IPL campaigns with more **realistic win probabilities**:\n- **Weak Teams (40%)** – inconsistent underdogs (e.g., PBKS 😅)\n- **Standard Teams (50%)** – the average IPL squad (e.g., RR)\n- **Strong Teams (60%)** – dominant forces who create momentum (e.g., MI)\n\n📌 For example, a team like **Mumbai Indians (MI)** might begin a season with a ~60% chance of winning any given match — about 10% more than an average team like **Rajasthan Royals**, and roughly 20% more than a struggling side like **RCB** (just kidding... or are we? 😄)\n\n---\n\nThis notebook combines mathematical insight, probability modeling, and real campaign examples to explore a core question:\n> \"Can a team qualify (or win) the IPL **without ever building real momentum** at some stage in the group stage?\"\n)\n### 🧮 Playoff Qualification with 7 vs 7+ Wins (IPL 2008–2024)\n\nBased on real IPL data:\n\n| Win Count | Qualified | Missed |\n|-----------|-----------|--------|\n| **7 Wins** | 5 teams   | 4 teams |\n| **7+ Wins** | 24 teams  | 0 teams |\n\n📌 Teams with **exactly 7 wins** have a 55% chance to qualify — often relying on **Net Run Rate (NRR)**.\n\n✅ Teams with **8 or more wins** have **always qualified**, making it the safer benchmark for playoff success.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Imports and Setup","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import itertools\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport pandas as pd\nimport random\nimport plotly.graph_objects as go\n","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-04-13T21:30:35.005535Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-04-13T21:30:35.005916Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-04-13T21:30:35.012526Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-04-13T21:30:35.005879Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-04-13T21:30:35.011293Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Parameters and Helper Functions","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"TOTAL_MATCHES = 14\nQUALIFY_WIN_THRESHOLD = 7\nSTRICT_QUALIFY_THRESHOLD = 8\n\ndef is_valid_sequence(seq):\n    \"\"\"Return True if sequence has no more than 2 consecutive wins.\"\"\"\n    count = 0\n    for outcome in seq:\n        if outcome == 'W':\n            count += 1\n            if count > 2:\n                return False\n        else:\n            count = 0\n    return True\n\ndef count_wins(seq):\n    return seq.count('W')","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-04-13T21:30:35.014313Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-04-13T21:30:35.014670Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-04-13T21:30:35.033572Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-04-13T21:30:35.014639Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-04-13T21:30:35.032744Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Equally strong teams vs Simulation of Weak,Standard & Strong team","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"all_sequences = list(itertools.product(['W', 'L'], repeat=TOTAL_MATCHES))\nvalid_sequences = [seq for seq in all_sequences if is_valid_sequence(seq)]\n\nqualifying_7plus = [seq for seq in valid_sequences if count_wins(seq) >= QUALIFY_WIN_THRESHOLD]\nqualifying_8plus = [seq for seq in valid_sequences if count_wins(seq) >= STRICT_QUALIFY_THRESHOLD]\n\nprint(f\"Total sequences: {len(all_sequences)}\")\nprint(f\"Valid sequences (no >2 consecutive wins): {len(valid_sequences)}\")\nprint(f\"Qualifying sequences (7+ wins): {len(qualifying_7plus)}\")\nprint(f\"Strict qualifying sequences (8+ wins): {len(qualifying_8plus)}\")","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-04-13T21:30:35.034545Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-04-13T21:30:35.034773Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-04-13T21:30:35.073627Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-04-13T21:30:35.034756Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-04-13T21:30:35.072745Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Win Distribution in Valid Sequences","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"win_distribution = {i: 0 for i in range(15)}\nfor seq in valid_sequences:\n    win_distribution[count_wins(seq)] += 1\n\nwin_df = pd.DataFrame(list(win_distribution.items()), columns=['Wins', 'Valid Sequence Count'])\nwin_df['Percentage'] = (win_df['Valid Sequence Count'] / len(valid_sequences)) * 100\n\nplt.figure(figsize=(10, 5))\nplt.bar(win_df['Wins'], win_df['Percentage'])\nplt.xlabel('Number of Wins')\nplt.ylabel('Percentage of Valid Sequences (%)')\nplt.title('Win Distribution (Max 2 Wins in a Row)')\nplt.grid(True)\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-04-13T21:30:35.075454Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-04-13T21:30:35.075725Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-04-13T21:30:35.329537Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-04-13T21:30:35.075703Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-04-13T21:30:35.328583Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Section 2: Simulated Seasons","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"In this analysis, we simulate the performance of a single team (categorized as weak, average, or strong) based on fixed win probabilities (e.g., 40%, 50%, or 60%) for each match.
